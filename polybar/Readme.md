# Hints
I have to different bars:
  - `pc_bar` is the polybar-file for my pc <br>
     I have 2 monitors so it will display on two different screens if it works. <br>
     You'll need to change following things:
     - Monitor-names
     - used modules
     - path to the executing files which are used in the modules
     
  - `laptop` is the polybar-file for my laptop <br>
    I'm using only one monitor so it should work for you but you still need to change the following things:
    - Monitor name
    - network interfaces
    - used modules
    - path to the executing files which are used in the modules
