## update
  - **HINT: IT WILL ONLY WORK FOR ARCH LINUX!!!**
  - **HINT: I'M USING `trizen` AS MY AUR INSTALLER!!! CHANGE IT IF NEEDED!!!** <br><br>
You can run it, by typing `update`. Than it'll ask you if you want to start `startx` <br>
if you are still in tty and not in your DE. <br><br>

You can remove this command if you want.

## cvimcache
It will remove the cache from vim e.g. if you didn't closed the last file safety. So you don't need to do it manually.
