" This makes vifm perform file operations on its own instead of relying on
" standard utilities like `cp`.  While using `cp` and alike is a more universal
" solution, it's also much slower when processing large amounts of files and
" doesn't support progress measuring.

" Trash Directory
" The default is to move files that are deleted with dd or :d to
" the trash directory.  If you change this you will not be able to move
" files by deleting them and then using p to put the file in the new location.
" I recommend not changing this until you are familiar with vifm.
" This probably shouldn't be an option.
